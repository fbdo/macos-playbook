# If you wish to use the SOCKS5 proxy feature as well, uncomment

# to have SOCKS5 on more than one port or on different network
# interfaces (specify explicit source address for that).

# Use -M first to detect the best NTLM settings for your proxy.
# Default is to use the only secure hash, NTLMv2, but it is not
# as available as the older stuff.
#
# This example is the most universal setup known to man, but it
# uses the weakest hash ever. I won't have it's usage on my
# conscience. :) Really, try -M first.
